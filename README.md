The Music Mood Lifter is a software system empowered by machine learning algorithms that can detect facial expressions from input faces. Based on the predicted mood, the system can list out appropriate songs for users to choose from. The inputs are images uploaded by users, and the outputs have the Spotify links that will direct users to the recommended songs. This application will be implemented through a webpage. Xception is used as the base model for recognizing facial emotion, and a handwritten multiclass neural network will be used to classify songs by moods.
